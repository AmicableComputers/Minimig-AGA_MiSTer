IMPORTANT - AGA CHIPSET stuff
- http://eab.abime.net/showpost.php?p=669147&postcount=77
- bitplane shifter problems - more 'undocumented' stuff ... (looks like the output shifter is actually 256 bit to allow 64-pixel fetches in lowres to be shifted on shres resolution - implemented)
- upper is probably wrong, shifter is 64bitsd plus additional shres shifter (two bits?)
- even that bitplane shifter is probably wrong: http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=71437
- CPU compatibility fixes are a must!
- CPU : add PACK & UNPK imstruction support (TG68KdotC_kernel.vhd, from line 2236 on -- also look at 68000 programmer's reference!)
- CPU really needs chipRAM 'turbo' reads AND writes!
- increment hpos counter in denise by two LSB bits (35ns counter)
- hdiwstrt & hdiwstop (HDIWHIGH) also have two new high-resolution bits
- sprites can be positioned on 35ns pixels - to add!
- sprite scandoubling DONE
- bitplanes scandoubling

MEDIUM - mostly firmware stuff
- fix firmware config, display config
- joystick autofire menu ?
- cpu turbo enable menu
- fast kickstart rtl / menu
- 1MB kickstart

LOW - waay down the line
- turbo blitter
- ethernet
- RTG
- AHI audio
